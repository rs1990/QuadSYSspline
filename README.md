QuadSYSspline
=============

This is a C++ implemetation of a Neural Network based Backstepping controller for use on quadcopters. It is 
based on the paper : A. Das and F. Lewis and S. Subbarao. "Dynamic Neural Network based Robust Backstepping 
Control approach for Quadrotors". In: Proceedings of AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit,
Honolulu, Hawaii, 2008


Goal points :

-> to complete the code.
-> to implement on Ardrone Parrot.
-> to compare simulation and test results
-> to integrate with the octocopter and use mavros
